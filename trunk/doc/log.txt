HOUR 1
- Project code layout
- Prepared placeholder assets for atoms.
- Base code structure for atom in place
HOUR 2
- Added basic dragging support for atoms.
- Added a simple random level initialization code
- Begun work on atom linking.
HOUR 3
- Got the linking rules and basic graphics working.
- Added a new rule to design, links work only on
    main structure
- Game appeared to be too easy, design revised to add particle movement
& penalties for particles that go off screen unlinked.
HOUR 4
- Added atom movement and goal mechanics. 
    Game now appears to be much more challenging.
- The goal code is not working correctly right now, atoms and links are not
    always removed correctly.
HOUR 5
- Goal mechanics fixed.
- Started creating classes to handle some basic graphics effects for the game.
HOUR 6
- Still working on game effects (droping point text), and points system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOUR 7
- Points and combo system now working. First extensive tests of the game:
Picking 32x32 spheres may be difficult when palying fast: spheres should be bigger.
Possibly less spheres around but faster game.
- Tried less, bigger spheres, seems to be working.
- Discovered that Picking is not working really well, probably needs revision.
HOUR 8
- Found a dirty solution to picking problems, but there is some nasty error
    hidden somewhere. I'll ignore it for now unless it shows up again.
- Added support for streaks.
HOUR 9
- Begun working on atom collision physics.
HOUR 10
- Atom physics pretty much working
- Basic level support
- Tried having atoms spawn on a specified position (side of screen)
    game is much much better this way (less confusion).
HOUR 11
- Game now stops when life is over.
- Atom physics are a little rough, movement is not really nice. need to smooth it out
    later on in developement if I have time.
- Done a little bit of parameter tweaking. The game still has the nasty bug with
picking. I need to solve this or at least find a workaround. It manifests more often when
a lot of atoms are on screen.
- Gameplay modified, allow for linking outside of main structure,
returned to random spawning of atoms. Seems to be more funny.
HOUR 12
- Revised physics code, some hacks added but now it seems to be
working much better.
- Prepared placeholders graphics for main, guide and game over screens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOUR 13
- Added support code for main, guide and game over screens, and prepared the main
state machine to handle game state transitions. 
HOUR 14
- Revised combo cont, now works with links.
HOUR 15
- First try with webserver and facebook integration. Discovered that canvas page max width is 760px so I
need to resize application screens.
- Started work on php DB pages.
HOUR 16
- First try with facebook code in flash application. App seems to be locking up when fb code is active.
- Login to facebook and friends list get now working. (Cite tutorial & facebook-flash-api)
HOUR 17
- Basic score uploading working. Quickly explored facebook feed publishing. 
Not able to get it working. Since I don't have a lot of time left, I have to drop this feature.
- Decided also to freeze top-ten feature for now. Game will just report player high score and
all-time, worldwide high score. PHP pages have been fixed to work this way.
HOUR 18
- Facebook login now works in desktop and web mode, to simplify debugging.
- Highscore downloading now working.
- Page in facebook does seems to overlap, check height.
- Upload score only when score > player highscore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOUR 19
- Game window now has rounded borders, looks better insite the facebook canvas.
HOUR 20
- Added glow effect to atoms and links
- Fixed points formatting.
- Revised points and combos
HOUR 21
- Added text overlays for game over, level up and game start.
HOUR 22
- Atom placeholders substituted with final versions.
- Added glow to color locked atoms and removed link wiggly movement,
    looks better.
- Points now updated and shown immediately upon link creation.
HOUR 23
- Added sounds.
- Removed the only partially working leaderboard and facebook integration code
to swith to MochiAdds. Outstanding service, leaderboards were integrated
using just a couple lines of code, plus MochiAds offers game hosting for free.
I whish I has discovered this service before spending so much time working
with the Facebook API and implementing my own Leaderboard DB and php code.
HOUR 24
- Finalized main screen.
- Finalized the guide and game over screen
- Corrected some final graphics and gameplay glitches.

FINAL TOUGHTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Game not as polished ad I whished but pretty close to what I had in mind.
- Lots of time spent on implementing my own leaderboard solution. Documenting better
at the beginning would have made me gain at least 2-3 developement hours.
- Having gameplay working since the very beginning was very important because
 - Allowed me to try the game since the beginning and tweak a lot of gameplay aspects 
 during developement.
 - Gameplay is the only thing that cannot be dropped from the game. Everything else, gfx
 quality, additional features like leaderboards etc. can be negotiated. Giving priority to
 gameplay mechanics is foundamental.
